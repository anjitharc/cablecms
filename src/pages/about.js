              WAn "About Us" Page is where you reveal your brand story, business
              values, mission, and experiences. Now the question is: why would
              you want to share all this information and make it appealing? The
              answer is simple: you want to tell your audience who you are, show
              them what you are good at, and tell them you are worthy of their
              trust. Think for a moment: would you rather purchase from a
              business you know nothing about, or would you go for somebody with
              a friendly face shared on their About page and a story that you
              find exciting? The latter one, right? A great About Us page not
              just portrays your story, qualities and provides an insight on how
              your business started, but it also helps you sell. When visitors
              become familiar with your story and connect with it, they're
              probably going to purchase from you. A well-planned About Us page
              can do this!
